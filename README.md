# adolfo
## setup:

>first, [*download* the zip file of this repository](https://github.com/iarwin/adolfo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

>this project is meant to be executed in windows, but in linux or mac will also work as long as you have properly installed the following dependences:

>[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (usually already installed in windows). if you want to use the FFmpeg that you downloaded just paste the path of the executable file in the config.txt file.
>
>you will also need [*python*](https://www.python.org/downloads/), which you can install in the microsoft store, and if you are in linux or mac it should be already installed by default (version over 3.6 is required)
>
>there are also 2 dependences you need to install from terminal ([discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) and [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)), which you can install by any terminal with command
```pip install --user discord.py python-dotenv```
>but in linux this could cause some errors, depending on how the environment is setted up, so you may need to [virtualize python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
